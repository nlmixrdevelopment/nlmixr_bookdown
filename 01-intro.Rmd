# Preface {-}
In pharmacometrics there are several population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling software packages. The `nlmixr` R package was developed for fitting general dynamic models, pharmacokinetic (PK) models and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models in particular, with either individual data or population data. The interesting part about `nlmixr` is that it is open-source and the whole workflow of modeling can be done solely in R !

## About this book {-}
This book provides guidance to using `nlmixr` and serves as a first reference manual, without the intent to cover every aspect of modeling or `nlmixr`.

We assume readers have a background in pharmacometric modeling and know how to use R. Basic knowledge is required and assumed on installing other software packages, such as Python. The installation of `nlmixr` and related software and packages is described in Chapter \@ref(install).

## Acknowledgements {-}
We are thankful for the time people are willing to spend on this project. There have been various interactions and contributions on GitHub. We would like to thank ... .



<!-- First chapter -->
# Introduction {#intro}
## Prerequisites {#prereq}
There are several packages and pieces of software that together create an environment that enables you to use `nlmixr`.

These packages and software are:

- [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) (and related GUIs, such as RGui and [`Rstudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/))
- [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) - i.e., [`SymPy`](http://www.sympy.org/nl/index.html)
- [`RxODE`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RxODE/index.html)
- [`nlmixr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlmixr/index.html)

Related custom packages used by `nlmixr` are:

- [`PreciseSums`](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/PreciseSums)
- [`SnakeCharmer`](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/SnakeCharmR)

Packages to support the use of `nlmixr` are:

- [`ShinyMixR`](https://richardhooijmaijers.github.io/shinyMixR/index.html)
- [`xpose.nlmixr`](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/xpose.nlmixr)

More on the installation of packages and software in Chapter \@ref(install).


## Workflow {#workflow}
The ability to perform population modeling in R provides an opportunity to work via a single unified workflow for data management, data exploration, data analysis and report writing.

`nlmixr` can be used directly from the R command line and there is another option: `ShinyMixR`. This package provides a means to build a project-centric workflow around `nlmixr` from the R command line and from a streamlined [`Shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application. This project tool was developed to enhance the usability and attractiveness of nlmixr, facilitating dynamic and interactive use in real-time for rapid model development. More on the use of `ShinyMixR` in Chapter \@ref(interface).
