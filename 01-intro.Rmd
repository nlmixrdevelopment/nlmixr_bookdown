# Introduction {#intro}

There are several software packages that can do population PKPD modeling.
...

`nlmixr` is an R package for fitting general dynamic models, pharmacokinetic (PK) models and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models in particular, with either individual data or population data. The interesting part about `nlmixr` is that it is open-source and the whole workflow of modeling can be done solely in R !

## Introduction to `nlmixr`

Under the hood `nlmixr` has five main modules:  

1. `dynmodel()` and its mcmc cousin `dynmodel.mcmc()` for nonlinear dynamic models of individual data; 
2. `nlme_lin_cmpt()`for one to three linear compartment models of population data with first order absorption, or i.v. bolus, or i.v. infusion using the nlme algorithm; 
3. `nlme_ode()` for general dynamic models defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of population data using the nlme algorithm; 
4. `saem_fit` for general dynamic models defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of population data by the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm;  
5. `gnlmm` for generalized non-linear mixed-models (possibly defined by ordinary differential equations) of population data by the adaptive Gaussian quadrature algorithm.



The installation is described in Chapter \@ref(install). A comparison to other software in made in Chapter \@ref(comparison).
