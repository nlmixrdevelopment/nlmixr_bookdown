# Preface {-}
In pharmacometrics there are several population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling software packages.

We developed the `nlmixr` R package for fitting general dynamic models, pharmacokinetic (PK) models and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models in particular, with either individual data or population data. The interesting part about `nlmixr` is that it is open-source and the whole workflow of modeling can be done solely in R !

## About this book {-}
This book provides user's guidance to `nlmixr` and serves as a first reference manual, without the intent to cover every aspect of modeling or `nlmixr`.

We assume readers have a background in pharmacometric modeling and know how to use R.

The installation is described in Chapter \@ref(install). A comparison to other software in made in Chapter \@ref(comparison).

# Introduction {#intro}
## Prerequisites {#prereq}
There are several packages and pieces of software that together make sure you can use 'nlmixr`.

These packages and software are:

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (and related GUIs, such as RGui and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/))
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [RxODE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RxODE/index.html)
- [nlmixr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlmixr/index.html)
- ShinyMixR


## Workflow {#workflow}
The ability to perform population modeling in R provides an opportunity to work via a single unified workflow for data management, data exploration, data analysis and report writing. 

`ShinyMixR` aims to provide a user-friendly tool for `nlmixr` based on [`Shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), which would facilitate a workflow around an `nlmixr` project. It is build as a project-centric, instead of interface-centric, workflow around `nlmixr` from the `R` command line and from a streamlined `Shiny` application. The [`shinydashboard`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinydashboard/shinydashboard.pdf) package provides a layer on top of `Shiny` to produce an easy-to-use dashboard which can be used for controlling and tracking runs with an nlmixr project, and was the basis for setting up the modular interface.

This project tool was enhances the usability and attractiveness of `nlmixr`, facilitating dynamic and interactive use in real-time for rapid model development. In this project-oriented structure, the command line and dashboard can be used independently and/or interdependently.

Using the `ShinyMixR`, the user specifies and controls an `nlmixr` project workflow entirely in `R`. Within a project folder, a structure can be created to include separate folders for models, data and runs. Functionality is available to edit and run model code, summarize and compare model outputs in a tabular fashion, and view model development using a tree paradigm. Inputs, outputs and metadata are stored in relation to the model code within the project structure (a discrete R object) to ensure traceability. 

Results are visualized by using modifications of existing packages (such as [`xpose.nlmixr`](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/xpose.nlmixr), user-written functions and packages, or pre-existing plotting functionality included in the `ShinyMixR` package. Results are reported using the [R3port](https://github.com/RichardHooijmaijers/R3port) package in pdf and html format.

More on the use of `ShinyMixR` in Chapter \@ref(interface).
