# Welcome to population modeling with R {-}
The fact that you are here suggest you have an interest to do population modeling in R ! Maybe you found this through our [nlmixr website](http://nlmixr.org/wp/). Maybe via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nlmixr), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/start/join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fgroups%2F8621368&trk=login_reg_redirect), [GitHub](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr). Either way: **welcome and join us in our journey to do population modeling with R !**

This book is intended to get you started with [nlmixr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlmixr/index.html), an R package for Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models in Population Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics. You'll get information on the package itself, its installation, interesting use cases and more.
